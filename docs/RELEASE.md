# Release Process

This document describes how to cut a new release of
`opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation`.

## Release Cadence

Releases are cut approximately every **6 weeks**, following the broader
OpenTelemetry release cadence. Patch releases (hotfixes) are cut as needed
between scheduled releases when a critical bug or security issue is found.

## Release Shepherd

Each release is owned by a **release shepherd** — one of the project
[maintainers](../README.md#maintainers). The shepherd is responsible for
driving the release end-to-end: tagging, monitoring the workflow, and
publishing the final release notes.

Shepherds rotate among maintainers across releases to share the load.

## Before You Release

1. **Ensure `main` is green.** All required CI workflows must be passing on
   the commit you intend to tag.

2. **Verify there are no pending breaking-change PRs** that should land before
   this release.

3. **Confirm the version number.** This project follows
   [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
   - `PATCH` (`v0.x.Y+1`) — bug fixes, no API changes
   - `MINOR` (`v0.X+1.0`) — new features, backward-compatible
   - `MAJOR` (`vX+1.0.0`) — breaking changes

4. **Check open issues and PRs** for anything that should be included in this
   release milestone.

## Release Steps

### 1. Create and push the version tag

Tags must follow the pattern `v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<PATCH>` (e.g., `v0.3.0`):

```sh
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

Pushing the tag triggers the [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml)
automatically.

### 2. Monitor the Release workflow

Open the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation/actions/workflows/release.yml)
and watch the `Build and Release` job. It runs the following steps:

1. Checks out the tagged commit
2. Sets up Go (version from `go.mod`)
3. Runs `make build-all` — cross-compiles `otelc` for all supported platforms
4. Creates a GitHub release and uploads the binaries

### 3. Review and polish the release

The workflow publishes the GitHub release live immediately using
`softprops/action-gh-release` with auto-generated release notes. After the
workflow completes:

1. Open the [Releases page](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-compile-instrumentation/releases)
2. Review the auto-generated release notes (derived from PR titles since the
   previous tag).
3. Edit the notes in place to add context, highlight breaking changes, or
   group entries as needed — the release is already public at this point.
4. Confirm the release page lists all 5 platform binaries as downloadable
   assets.

## Cross-Compilation Targets

`make build-all` compiles `otelc` for the following platforms:

| OS      | Architecture | Binary name                  |
|---------|--------------|------------------------------|
| Linux   | amd64        | `otelc-linux-amd64`          |
| Linux   | arm64        | `otelc-linux-arm64`          |
| macOS   | amd64        | `otelc-darwin-amd64`         |
| macOS   | arm64        | `otelc-darwin-arm64`         |
| Windows | amd64        | `otelc-windows-amd64.exe`    |

All binaries are uploaded to the GitHub release as downloadable assets.

## Post-Release Verification

After the release is published:

1. **Download a binary** for your platform from the release page and run:

   ```sh
   ./otelc version
   ```

   Confirm it prints the expected version, commit hash, and build date.

2. **Verify the GitHub release** lists all 5 platform binaries.

3. **Announce the release** in the
   [#otel-go-compt-instr-sig](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C088D8GSSSF)
   Slack channel with a link to the release notes.

## Patch Releases (Hotfixes)

For critical bug fixes between scheduled releases:

1. If the fix is on `main`, simply tag from `main` using the next `PATCH`
   version (e.g., `v0.2.1`).

2. If `main` has moved on with unrelated changes that should not be included,
   create a release branch from the previous tag:

   ```sh
   git checkout -b release/v0.2.x v0.2.0
   git cherry-pick <fix-commit-sha>
   git push origin release/v0.2.x
   git tag v0.2.1
   git push origin v0.2.1
   ```

3. Follow the same [release steps](#release-steps) above.

4. If a release branch was created, open a PR to merge the fix back to `main`
   to avoid regression.
