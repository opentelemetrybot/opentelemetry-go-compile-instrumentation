# Adding a New Instrumentation Hook

This guide outlines the workflow for adding compile-time instrumentation for a third-party library.

The process consists of three main steps:

1. **Define Rules**: Create a YAML file to match the target package and function.
2. **Implement Hooks**: Write the `Before` and `After` hook functions in Go.
3. **Verify**: Add tests to ensure the instrumentation works as expected.

---

## 1. Define Rules

Rules are defined in YAML format and stored under `instrumentation/<import_path>/`. This file tells `otelc` which functions to instrument.

Create a new file under `instrumentation/<import_path>/.../otelc.yaml`, where `<import_path>` is the Go import path of the library being instrumented.

Rule files must be named either `otelc.yaml` or `*.otelc.yaml`.

For example:

```text
instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/server/otelc.yaml
instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/client/client.otelc.yaml
```

Below is an example configuration for instrumenting a function `NewServer`:

```yaml
inject_to_grpc_newserver:
  target: google.golang.org/grpc
  version: v1.63.0,v1.70.0
  where:
    func: NewServer
  do:
    - inject_hooks:
        before: BeforeNewServer
        after: AfterNewServer
        path: go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/instrumentation/google.golang.org/grpc/server
```

- `target`: Import path of the package to instrument.
- `version`: Version range to match. The left bound is inclusive, the right bound is exclusive. If version is not specified, the rule is applicable to all versions.
- `where`: Non-package selectors. `func` names the function to hook.
- `do`: Ordered list of modifiers. `inject_hooks` declares this rule type and carries:
  - `before` / `after`: names of the hook functions.
  - `path`: import path where the hook functions are defined.

> [!NOTE]
> The 2-tier `where`/`do` schema and all other rule types are documented in [rules.md](rules.md). The schema invariants are recorded in [ADR-0003](adr/0003-structured-rule-schema.md).

## 2. Implement Hooks

Hook functions are standard Go functions. We place them in the package specified by the `path` field in the rule YAML.

### Hook Definition

The first parameter must always be `hook.HookContext`.

- **Before Hook**: Parameters match the target function's arguments.
- **After Hook**: Parameters match the target function's return values.

Target function:

```go
func NewServer(opts ...grpc.ServerOption) *grpc.Server
```

Hook implementation:

```go
package server

import (
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otelc/pkg/hook"
	"google.golang.org/grpc"
)

// BeforeNewServer matches the arguments of NewServer
func BeforeNewServer(ictx hook.HookContext, opts ...grpc.ServerOption) {
	// Logic to execute before the original function
}

// AfterNewServer matches the return value of NewServer
func AfterNewServer(ictx hook.HookContext, server *grpc.Server) {
	// Logic to execute after the original function
}
```

If we cannot import a specific type (e.g., it is unexported), we can use `interface{}` in the hook signature.

### Runtime Enable/Disable Gate

Every instrumentation must be switchable at runtime through
`OTEL_GO_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS` / `OTEL_GO_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS` (see
[Configuration](configuration.md)). This is not automatic: the hooks are always woven into
the binary at build time, so each instrumentation is responsible for checking whether it is
enabled before doing any work.

Declare an `instrumentationKey` and an enabler in the instrumentation package:

```go
const instrumentationKey = "GRPC"

type grpcServerEnabler struct{}

func (g grpcServerEnabler) Enable() bool {
	return runtime.Instrumented(instrumentationKey)
}

var serverEnabler = grpcServerEnabler{}
```

Then return early from **every** exported hook before it touches any state:

```go
func BeforeNewServer(ictx hook.HookContext, opts ...grpc.ServerOption) {
	if !serverEnabler.Enable() {
		return
	}
	// ...
}
```

Notes:

- The key is matched case-insensitively, so `instrumentationKey = "GRPC"` is written as
  `grpc` in the environment variable.
- Packages that instrument two sides of the same library share one key. `grpc/client` and
  `grpc/server` are both `GRPC`; `kafka-go/producer` and `kafka-go/consumer` are both
  `KAFKA`.
- Gate paired before/after hooks at the same point, so any bookkeeping they share (depth
  counters, `ictx.SetData` values) stays balanced when the instrumentation is disabled.
- When a before/after pair shares one `hook.HookContext` (one call in, one call out), have
  the before hook store its `Enable()` result via `ictx.SetKeyData` and have the after hook
  read it back instead of calling `Enable()` again. Otherwise a call whose environment
  variable changes mid-flight sees the before hook and after hook disagree, desyncing
  whatever they gate together.
- Cover the gate in unit tests with `t.Setenv`, asserting both that a disabled
  instrumentation emits nothing and that an explicitly enabled one still works.

### Limitations

The constraints below apply to hook implementations. For runtime symptoms (spans not
appearing, instrumentation not applied), see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

When implementing hooks, we must adhere to certain limitations:

1. **Restricted Imports**: If we are instrumenting a library (e.g., `github.com/foo/bar`), our hook code can only import from:
   - The Target Library (`github.com/foo/bar`)
   - OpenTelemetry packages
   - Standard Library packages

   Importing other third-party libraries is not allowed.

2. **Generic Functions**: If the target function is generic, we cannot use `HookContext` APIs to modify parameters or return values (e.g., `SetParam`, `SetReturnVal`).

### GLS Operation for OTel SDK Instrumentation

This section explains how goroutine-local storage (GLS) is used by the OTel SDK instrumentation.

#### Background

The OTel SDK normally propagates span context via `context.Context`. Some code paths still call APIs such as `trace.SpanFromContext(context.Background())`, where no span exists in the provided context.

To improve compatibility, this project stores the active span chain in goroutine-local storage and bridges selected OTel SDK APIs to that state during compile-time instrumentation.

#### High-Level Flow

The GLS flow is implemented through three parts:

1. Runtime GLS fields and helpers in the instrumented runtime package.
2. Injected OTel SDK trace helper file (`otel_trace_context.go`).
3. Hook rules that add/remove/read spans at key OTel SDK call sites.

At runtime:

- On span creation (`newRecordingSpan`, `newNonRecordingSpan`), the new span is added to GLS.
- On span end (`recordingSpan.End`, `nonRecordingSpan.End`), the span is removed from GLS.
- On `trace.SpanFromContext`, if the original return span is invalid, the hook tries GLS as a fallback.

#### Main Components

##### 1) Runtime GLS accessors

`instrumentation/runtime/runtime_gls.go` provides low-level accessors:

- `GetTraceContextFromGLS()`
- `SetTraceContextToGLS(interface{})`
- `GetBaggageContainerFromGLS()`
- `SetBaggageContainerToGLS(interface{})`

It also defines `OtelContextCloner` for goroutine propagation logic.

##### 2) Injected trace context holder

`instrumentation/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/trace/otel_trace_context.go` defines an internal linked-list based trace context container in GLS:

- add span to current goroutine context
- delete span when ended
- fetch current span for fallback lookup

The max chain size is configurable:

- env var: `OTEL_GLS_MAX_SPANS`
- default: `1000`
- invalid or non-positive values are ignored (default remains in effect)
- once a goroutine's live (unended) span count reaches this limit, new spans are not tracked for
  implicit propagation; `SpanFromContext(context.Background())` on that goroutine keeps returning
  whatever was already on top of the stack. This is logged at debug level
  (`OTEL_LOG_LEVEL=debug`) rather than failing silently.

Span end-state is tracked in a map shared across all goroutines (so a span ended on one goroutine
is recognized as ended by any other goroutine holding a GLS clone of it), bounded separately:

- env var: `OTEL_GLS_MAX_SPAN_STATES`
- default: `100000`
- once full, the oldest tracked entry is evicted (also logged at debug level) to make room for
  new spans; eviction always targets the oldest entry deterministically, never an arbitrary one.

##### 3) Hook integration points

Configured in `instrumentation/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/hook/hooks.yaml` and implemented in `instrumentation/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/hook/`:

- `tracer_setup.go`: add span to GLS after span creation
- `span_setup.go`: remove span from GLS before span end
- `span_context.go`: fallback to GLS in `trace.SpanFromContext`

#### Why GLS is Needed

GLS fallback is useful for compatibility with existing code that:

- does not pass context through all call boundaries
- uses `context.Background()` at read points
- expects current span lookup to still work in instrumented binaries

This is especially helpful for auto-instrumentation scenarios where user code is unchanged.

#### Operational Notes

- GLS state is scoped to a goroutine. Correct context propagation across goroutines still depends on runtime propagation hooks.
- The fallback behavior only applies where configured by instrumentation rules.
- This mechanism is intended for compile-time instrumentation internals; it is not a public API contract.

## 3. Testing

### Unit Tests

We verify the instrumentation through unit and integration tests.

Create standard Go tests (`*_test.go`) alongside the hook functions to verify logic.

```bash
go test ./instrumentation/<import_path>/...
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests run the instrumented code to ensure hooks are triggered correctly. These are located in `test/integration/`.

We should:

- Build the test app with the `otelc` tool and run the produced binary. The binary must live under `test/apps/<name>/...`
- Assert exported telemetry (traces/spans).
- Validate semantic conventions (required + recommended attributes) for the spans created by the instrumentation.

To run integration tests:

```bash
make test-integration
```

## 4. Register the Instrumentation

If your PR adds a new user-facing instrumentation, create a PR to add the instrumentation to the OpenTelemetry registry in the `opentelemetry.io` repository.

Follow the [OpenTelemetry Registry contribution guide](https://opentelemetry.io/ecosystem/registry/adding/).

Not every instrumentation package should be listed. Internal helper packages (for example, `basic`, `runtime`, or packages that only provide implementation details for other instrumentations) generally do not need registry entries.

## 5. Verify

Check that your instrumentation package has the following elements:

- A rule YAML under `instrumentation/<import_path>/.../otelc..yaml` with a correct `target` and version range.
- Hook implementation under `instrumentation/<import_path>/...`.
- Unit tests alongside the hooks for logic-level behavior.
- Integration tests in `test/integration/` that execute an instrumented binary and validate spans/attributes.
- If applicable, a PR has been opened to add the instrumentation to the OpenTelemetry registry in the `opentelemetry.io` repository.
