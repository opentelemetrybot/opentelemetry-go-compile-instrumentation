# Configuration and Fine-Tuning

This guide covers how to scope, filter, and tune `otelc` instrumentation for your project. It
assumes you have already completed the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) setup. For the full
rule schema reference, see [Instrumentation Rules](rules.md).

## Selecting Instrumentations

By default, `otelc` applies all instrumentation rules from its embedded bundle to every
dependency it finds in your module graph. This zero-configuration mode works well for
getting started: run `otelc go build` and all [supported libraries](getting-started.md#supported-libraries)
are instrumented automatically.

For projects that need tighter control — because they use a narrow set of libraries, because
they ship a library themselves, or because they need reproducible, auditable builds — you can
declare exactly which instrumentations to enable. See [External Configuration Sources](external-configuration.md)
for the `otel.instrumentation.go` mechanism that makes this explicit and source-controlled.

### Runtime selection without rebuilding

The `otel.instrumentation.go` mechanism above is resolved at build time. To turn instrumentations
on or off at **runtime** — without rebuilding the binary — set these environment variables, which
the injected SDK reads at startup:

- **`OTEL_GO_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS`** — comma-separated allowlist. When set, only the listed
  instrumentations run; all others are turned off.
- **`OTEL_GO_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS`** — comma-separated denylist. The listed instrumentations
  are turned off. Applied after the enabled list.

Names are lowercase and matched case-insensitively, e.g. `nethttp,grpc`. When neither variable is
set, all instrumentations compiled into the binary run (the default). When both are set, the
enabled allowlist is applied first, then the disabled list removes entries from it.

```bash
# Run only net/http and gRPC instrumentation
OTEL_GO_ENABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=nethttp,grpc ./myapp

# Run everything except net/http
OTEL_GO_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS=nethttp ./myapp
```

> [!NOTE]
> These variables only gate instrumentations already compiled into the binary. To control what is
> compiled in, use `otel.instrumentation.go` (see
> [External Configuration Sources](external-configuration.md)).

## Rule Sources and Precedence

`otelc` resolves rules from the following sources, in priority order (highest first):

1. **`OTELC_RULES` environment variable** — path to a rule file or comma-separated list of
   paths. When set, all other sources are ignored.
2. **`--rules` flag** — same format as `OTELC_RULES`. Takes effect when `OTELC_RULES` is not
   set.
3. **Tool files** (`otel.instrumentation.go` / `otelc.tool.go`) — when the project declares
   instrumentations explicitly. See [External Configuration Sources](external-configuration.md).
4. **Embedded defaults** — the instrumentation bundle built into `otelc`, applied when none of
   the above are present.

Each source entirely replaces those below it. There is no merging: when `--rules` is provided,
tool files and the embedded bundle are not consulted.

### Using `--rules` for development and debugging

`--rules` loads rules from a file or a directory tree. Paths can be comma-separated to load
from multiple locations:

```bash
# Single file
otelc --rules my-rules.yml go build .

# Directory — all *.otelc.yml and otelc.yml files inside are loaded
otelc --rules custom-rules/ go build .

# Multiple sources
otelc --rules base-rules/,extra.otelc.yml go build .
```

> [!NOTE]
> `--rules` is a global `otelc` flag and must appear **before** the `go` subcommand.
> `otelc go` passes all arguments after `go` directly to the Go toolchain without parsing
> them, so `otelc go build --rules ...` would forward `--rules` to `go build` instead.

The `OTELC_RULES` environment variable accepts the same format and is useful in CI pipelines
where you want to inject rules without modifying the build command:

```bash
OTELC_RULES=ci-rules/ otelc go build .
```

> [!NOTE]
> `--rules` and `OTELC_RULES` are intended for development and debugging, not for production
> configuration. For stable, versioned instrumentation, use the `otel.instrumentation.go`
> mechanism described in [External Configuration Sources](external-configuration.md).

## Narrowing What Gets Instrumented

Rules target packages and locations within them using three fields — the full schema is in
[Instrumentation Rules](rules.md). This section covers when to reach for each one.

- **`target`** — the package import path. Use an exact path for a single package, a
  [glob](rules.md#glob-targets) (`google.golang.org/grpc*`) to cover a package family, or
  `$root` to match your own module without hardcoding its path. See
  [Special `target` values](rules.md#special-target-values).
- **`version`** — restricts the rule to a [version range](rules.md#top-level-fields).
  Omit to match all versions.
- **`where.file`** predicates narrow to specific source files:
  - `has_func` / `has_struct` — when the same function name appears in multiple files and
    only one should be hooked.
  - `has_package` — use alongside a glob target to distinguish `foo` from `foo_test` within
    the same match.
  - `is_test` — restrict a rule to test builds (`otelc go test`) or exclude them. Has no
    effect under `otelc go build`.
  - `all-of`, `one-of`, `not` — compose predicates. See
    [`where.file` semantics](rules.md#wherefile-semantics).

**Planned:** Source-level opt-out pragmas (`//otelc:ignore`) are planned (#469).

## Runtime Tuning

`otelc` injects an OpenTelemetry SDK initialization package into instrumented binaries. The
SDK reads standard OTel environment variables at startup. There is no `otelc`-specific
configuration for exporters, samplers, or resource attributes — set those through the
[OTel SDK environment variable specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/configuration/sdk-environment-variables/).

`otelc`-specific runtime knobs beyond the standard OTel variables:

- **`OTEL_GLS_MAX_SPANS`** — controls the depth of the goroutine-local storage (GLS) span
  stack. Instrumentation that does not pass `context.Context` through all call boundaries
  relies on GLS to propagate trace context. Increasing `OTEL_GLS_MAX_SPANS` beyond the default
  accommodates deeper call stacks; see
  [GLS operation notes](../instrumentation/go.opentelemetry.io/otel/README.md) for the
  operational constraints.
- **`OTEL_GO_SIMPLE_SPAN_PROCESSOR`** — set to `true` to use `SimpleSpanProcessor` instead of
  the default `BatchSpanProcessor` for the trace exporter, exporting each span immediately
  rather than in batches. Useful for debugging when you need spans to appear without waiting
  for a batch timeout, at the cost of export throughput. Must be exactly the lowercase string
  `true`; unlike `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` below, other values (`True`, `TRUE`, `1`) are ignored.

One standard OTel variable worth calling out explicitly is **`OTEL_SDK_DISABLED`**: set to
`true` (case-insensitive) to disable the injected SDK entirely — no providers are installed
and no telemetry is collected or exported. Every other value, including unset, leaves the SDK
enabled.

## Verifying Your Configuration

After a build, the file `.otelc-build/matched.json` lists every rule that matched a dependency
and the locations it was applied. Inspect it to confirm that the instrumentations you expect
are active:

```bash
cat .otelc-build/matched.json | jq '.[].Name'
```

If instrumentation is not applied, `otelc` prints a warning to stderr:

```
Warning: no instrumentation will be applied
```

Common causes:

- The `target` import path does not match any dependency in the module graph (check with
  `go list -m all`).
- The `version` range excludes the version actually in use.
- A `--rules` or `OTELC_RULES` override replaced the rules that would have matched.
- The project uses `otel.instrumentation.go` but the declared packages have no matching rules.

For a structured diagnosis workflow, see [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md).

The `.otelc-build/` directory is retained after every build and removed only when you run
`otelc cleanup`. It also contains `debug.log`, `debug/main/otelc.runtime.go`, and other
artifacts described in [Inspecting Build Artifacts](troubleshooting.md#inspecting-build-artifacts).
